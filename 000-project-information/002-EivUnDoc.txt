= The EivUnDoc-format =

"EivUnDoc-format" stands for "Eivu's  Universal Doccumentation -format" and
it's the format of all of my  text documents. The "Universal" here does not
mean that I expect  everyone to follow said format, but  rather than in the
context  of my  work it  is the  "universal" format  of documentation.  The
format itself  is made  for plain  text (.txt) of  UTF-8 encoding.  Thus it
functions akin  to markup languages  by using special characters  to format
the text, however with the difference that where as markup languages can be
converted  to  for  example  html,   EivUnDoc-format  is  not  made  to  be
convertable to any  other format. Thus I  try to make the  format itself as
readable as possible in the pure form.


== Headers ==

Headers in EivUnDoc are rather simple. They are formed with text surrounded
by =-symbols to  indicate the header hierarchy. For example,  a header like
"= Example ="  would be equivalent to  a markdown "# Example"  and a header
like "== Example2 ==" would be equivalent to "## Example2".
    Headers are seperated from paragraphs with 2 and 1 empty lines. 2 empty
lines come after the text before the header, and 1 empty line seperates the
paragraph from it's corresponding headers.


== Paragraphs ==

Paragraphs in  EivUnDoc consist of  75-character long lines  of unformatted
text. Lines are manually wrapped by word.
    New paragraphs are indented by four  spaces compared to the rest of the
text. The  four spaces are counted  in the over all  75-character limit per
line. Thus all lines will contain a maximum of 75-characters.
