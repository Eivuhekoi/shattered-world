= Isékejat =

Isékejat (eng.  Era of  Sorrow) is  the name  given to  the period  of time
during  which Aminu's  Okánet  cracked  down on  any  perceived threats  to
Aminu's position of  power. It began response to the  growing "Followers of
the Old-Ones"  sect of Wanderish  Religion, which rejected the  divinity of
the Ashtree  and instead claimed that  a being known as  "the Old-Ones" was
the true divine power.
    Gradually, the  crack down  grew in scale,  reaching its  heights right
before the start of the Wanderish Civil War.


== Moitatvife Kjelan ==

Moitatvife  kjelan (eng.  The  Hand  of the  Ashtree,  lit.  Guards of  the
Ashtree) was a semi-secret agency of  Aminu's okánet during the early parts
of  the Isékejat.  They job  was  to take  take down  the Okánet's  enemies
without the public knowning they existed  in the first place. As such, both
the agency  and their operations  were highly confedential,  although their
success at remaining  so wasn't always the best, thus  the existance of the
agency was sort of know by the public.
    The Moitatvife  kjelan was  eventually retired  as the  Isékejat turned
into  the Wanderish  Civil  War.  However, a  small,  extremely devout  and
secretive part continued the agency's legacy under the banner of Moitatvife
Heléje (eng. Order  of the Ashtree) and eventually the  Heljéna (eng. Order
of Saviours, lit "Most devout")
