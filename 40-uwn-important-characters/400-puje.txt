= Puje, the first shaper in Nakapa =

Puje was the first shaper in the world of Nakapa, and most likely the being
with the most  impact on the world's history, as  they were responsible for
the event known as "The Shaping  of Nakapa". Their exact motives and origin
are unknown, as is with many shapers


== The arrival ==

Puje arrived  in Nakapa  when it  was still in  its primordial  ashen form,
about 4000 years before the beginning of the wanderish calendar. However by
that time  the their  arrival and  the events  surrounding the  Shaping had
become myths in the wanderish religion.
    From the moment Puje arrived, they  began their work on changing Nakapa
so that  it would  conform to  their strict  idea of  order and  unity. And
perhaps Nakapa,  as an  opposite to  it by its  chaotic nature,  posed some
"moral enemy", which was why they chose it instead of some easier world. Or
perhaps it was just a result of their admittedly large amount of ambition.
