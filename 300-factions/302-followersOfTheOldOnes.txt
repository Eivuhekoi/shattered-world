= Followers of the Old-Ones =

The "Followers of  the Old-Ones" were pre-shattering sect  of wanderers who
rejected the traditional Wanderish-mythos, and claimed that the Ashtree was
not infact divine or  unique in power. They based this  on claims that they
had been  contacted by  a "being  more ancient and  powerful than  even the
Ashtree". This  being was  a shaper by  the name of  Vanahai, but  to these
wanderers they introduced themselves as "the Old-Ones".
    This was taken as  an attempted coup by the then  leader of the Ok√°net,
Moiffe Aminu, and they used their position as the Ash-Speaker to label this
new religion  as a heretical, corrupted  form of the "truth".  And put into
motion a campaing that would eventually spark the Wanderish civil war.
