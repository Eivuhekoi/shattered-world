= Entry numbers =

As this  project is  split into  various different  documents, a  method of
organization is a necessity. I have  decided to employ a document numbering
system for this, which you can most likely rather clearly see.
    The  project root  directory consists  of subdirectories  named with  a
prefix number, follower  by an english word describing the  category of the
document. The files  in the directories are named in  a similar manner, but
instead of two numbers, there are three. The first two numbers are the same
as  the numbers  of its  directory, while  the last  is an  ordering number
within the directory itself.

    -- directory name examples --
00-project-information/001-entryNumbering.txt
60-concepts/600-time.txt

    The numbers  themselves also  indicate the  category of  the directory.
however as  this is not as  intuitive as just using  English, numbers alone
are not  used expect  in the  case of  refering to  related documents  in a
document's footer section. I have chosen to use numbers there as within the
scop of this project, these numbers act  like the url of a website and just
using  the number  gives the  location of  the document  while keeping  the
footer section more concise.
