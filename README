= Introduction =

A Shattered World, alternatively known as Asénuve Nakapa or "AN", is a long
time world-building project of mine that I  have been working on and off on
for almost  four years. Throughout  this time,  the project has  changed in
numerous ways. What originally began as an attempt at writing a short-story
became a novel and as the ratio of work done on the world-building compared
to the work done on the story itself began to lean heavily in the direction
of the  former, I  decided to turn  the project  into a what  it is  now: A
world-building project first. But what is "A Shattered World?"

== What is "A Shattered World?" ==

Shattered World is first and foremost the story of a world called "Nakapa",
which  through  a  single  unfortunate  event was  sent  into  a  chain  of
increasingly unfortunate events  that eventually resulted in  it becoming a
barely  habitable  archipeligo  of  countless  floating  islands  scattered
throughout  a  dense,  fog-lik  substance   that  slowly  breaks  down  and
assimilates anything that  stay in it for too long  (bar a few expections).
However,  much  of this  is  unknown  to  the  inhabitants of  Nakapa,  for
knowledge about the past has  largely either been forgotten or purposefully
destroyed in an  attempted revenge against the  "World-Breakers". Still for
the  ease of  explanation  I  usually divide  Nakapa's  history into  three
distinct eras:

1. Pre-Arrivial Nakapa (PAN)
   - Nakapa as it was before the arrival of Puje, first of the shapers.
2. United or Wanderish Nakapa (UN/WN/UWN)
   - Nakapa as it was during the time of the Wanderish empire, when the
     Wanderers ruled all through the land.
3. Post-Shattering Nakapa (PSN)
   - Nakapa in it's current state.


= Why the format? =

I attempt to keep all my work  as inexlusive to a particular format, device
or other thing  that may at some  point become obselete. As of  the time of
writing this, the  plain text format (.txt) is  almost universally accepted
and I do  not expect it to  change anytime soon, and as  plain text doesn't
rely on formatting in anyway (not even the simple ways of markdown or other
markup languages)  no software for  rendering such formats is  needed. Thus
the hope of utilizing  plain text as my default format  is that nobody will
be  unable to  view the  content regarless  of the  device they  are using.
Furthermore, I  hope that the  choice of  utilizing local files  instead of
something hosted on a website is able to circumvent difficulties in:

1. getting a server to host it on,
2. having to rely on a service provider that may at any moment choose to
   stop providing their service,
3. making ability to see the content difficult for people with bad internet
   connections. Thus if one has good enough of a connection to download the
   file, they can read it as they please.

Unfortunately  though,  none of  these  listed  potentials are  guarenteed.
Neither is  that .txt (or  the UTF-8 encoding) won't  at some point  in the
future become an obselete format.
