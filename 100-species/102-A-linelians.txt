= Linelians =

Linelians are one of the sentient species  in the world of Nakapa. They are
closely related to  the wanderers, much like their  distant cousins, having
descended from them. However the chaotic fog as altered their being to such
a degree  that resemblance to  their ancestors is  all but gone,  much like
what   happened   to  their   distant   cousins   the  Farlings   and   the
Majak. Additionally  these three  species are  occasionally referred  to as
"The Wanderian Species" as they are share  in common the fact that they are
descendant from the wanderers.
    Linelians are tall, lanky beings native to the shard-cluster of Lineli,
named after  a village by the  same name that  used to be there  before the
shattering.  Lineli, being  one  of the  larger  stable shard-clusters  has
become something  of a  secondary center for  civilization, with  the other
major  center  being  the  city of  Leznakvaiju.  Although  Leznakvaiju  is
undoutebly the larger,  and more prestegious settlement, Lineli  is still a
notable location.


== Customs and traditions ==

Out of the wanderish species, the linelians remain more conservative to the
original customs and traditions of wanderers before the rise of Aminu. This
is due  to the wanderers who  would eventually become the  linelians having
been a part of the anti-ok√°net forces during the Wanderish Civil War.

=== Religion ===

Linelians still  largely remain  faithful to the  Ashtree, although  it has
taken a much  more symbolic, invisible form  as it no longer  exists in the
world   of  Nakapa.   Sites  of   worship  for   linelians  thus   are  the
Ashen-Saplings.
