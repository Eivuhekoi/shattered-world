= Wanderers =

Wanderers are  one of, if not  the most, ancient species  of Nakapa, having
been  created by  directly  as  a result  of  Puje's  "Shaping of  Nakapa".
However, over time  they have forgotten their direct relation  to a shaper,
and the only remnants of it that still remain are only found in the form of
mythology. Despite their previously  rather prestigious position, wanderers
are now  seen as bothersome,  mysterious hermits,  the arrival of  whom can
mean nothing good.
    Furthermore   most  other   sentient   species  of   Nakapa,  bar   the
Hollow-Dwellers, are in some way related  to the wanderers. Be it by direct
relation  as  with Linelians,  Farlings  and  Majaks  (due to  the  chaotic
influence of the Fog) or indirectly as with Mimics and Factorians.

== Physiology and mannerisms ==

Wanderers are  tall, humanoid  beings with skin  resembling bark  and heads
crowned by branch-like horns. The  wanderers who still remain unchanged are
often those who used to belong to the "Old Ok√°net", and thus their reaction
to the  Death of the  Ashtree and the following  Shattering was to  go into
self-imposed exile for a perceived "embarassment to the entire world". Thus
wanderers tend to be secretive, beings  who prefer to live away from anyone
as  much as  possible.  But as  the fog  renders  most places  inhabitable,
communties  of wanderers  have formed  around small  Ashen-Saplings on  the
outskirts between the Far-Fog and the Inner-Fog.
