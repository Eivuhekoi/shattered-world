= Shapers =

Shapers  are not  a  singular species,  but rather  a  collective term  for
various beings,  both related  and unrelated, with  abilities to  alter, or
shape, reality  in varying ways.  The origins  and motives of  most shapers
remain unknown  as they  are not  often seen  and they  don't see,  keen on
explaining why they are doing things  the way they are. However, most major
shapers have arrived into the world of Nakapa from outside it.


== Physiology ==

Shapers  do not  inherently share  a common  physiology. Out  of the  known
shapers, two have  been humanoid (Puje and Veteje). How  ever this is still
not  enought to  claim  that  all shapers  are  humanoid, especially  since
another of these known shapers is explicitly lacking a physical form at all
(Vanahai).


== Behaviour and motives ==

Just like  with their physiology,  shapers do not  share a singular  set of
motives and behaviours. Some, like Puje,  wish to shape reality as they see
fit, while others,  like Veteje, seem to treat truly  care about the people
of the  worlds they arrive  in. Shapers seem  to be at  least knowledgeable
about the existance of other shapers,  and sometimes this can manifest in a
purposefully tampering  with another  shaper's creations, as  happened with
Vanahai and the  Followers of the Old-Ones just before  the Wanderish Civil
war,  just  before  the  Shattering.  Still  it  is  unknown  if  Vanahai's
involvement was coincidence or if shapers do actually want to mess with the
creations of other  shapers. Still, the behaviour of  Veteje might indicate
that the latter might be the case, although it does not explain why.


== Known Shapers ==

=== Puje, the First ===

Puje is the first of the shapers known to have arrived into the world of
Nakapa, and arguably the one responsible for sending the world down the path
of becoming what it is now.

=== Veteje, the Benevolent ===

=== Vanahai, the Collective ===
