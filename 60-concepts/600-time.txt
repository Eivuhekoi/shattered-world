= Timekeeping in Nakapa =

The most common  method of keeping tack  of time in the world  of Nakapa is
the "New  Way", that  has largely  replaced the "Old  Way" used  before the
Shattering, and is still being sued by some wanderers. In addition to these
two  other species  have their  own ways.  These include  the Hollow-Folk's
"Years after Arrival", which has been in use for a long time, the Factorian
"Cycles", and the Majak "Days of Liberation".


== Old Way ==

The old way  was the system of  timekeeping used by during the  rule of the
wanderish empire  and the following  Okánet, though in said  transition the
the number of years that had passed was set back to 0, thus the Old Way can
be further subdivided  into the Okánet and Imperial time.  However, as only
the number of years is different, they are largely interchangeable.
