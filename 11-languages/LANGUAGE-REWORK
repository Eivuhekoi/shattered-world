= Language rework of "A shattered world" =

In  some of  the entries  in  this project,  you have  probably seen  words
written in a language that is clearly not English. The language these words
are written  in is  an old  conlang (constructed  language) of  mine called
"Avát" which  I created a few  years ago for  this very project, but  for a
while now I have  been thinking of doing a language  rework. This is mainly
because I feel  that Avát, as my  first ever proper conlang,  should not is
unfit to  the represent this  project since in all  honesty it is  a rather
poorly made  language. It fails in  various ways but the  most important of
them for  me (in the  context of  this project) is  that it fails  in being
naturalistic. It  was created in a  vacuum, during a time  when the project
was in a very  different state when there were no  other species beside the
wanderers, for whom  it was created. And  I know that most  people wont see
these unnaturalistic elements or the other  reasons why I feel that Avát is
unfit  to  be the  language  representing  A  Shattered World.  However,  I
personally see it and  as A Shattered World is very  much a passion project
of mine, I feel it needs to be changed.
    At first I tried to shift it to  be a lingua france, or a common tongue
for communication between  speakers of different languages.  This was still
during  a  time when  I  was  formatting this  project  as  it if  were  an
encyclopedia written  in universe. However, the  unnaturalistic elements of
the language still continued to irk me even then.
